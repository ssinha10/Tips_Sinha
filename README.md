# Pre-work - *Tips_Sinha*

**Tips_Sinha** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **SURAJ SINHA**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [-] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
      This is not required in my application because the user can select any tip percentage he/she wishes.
The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added Tip Slider to select the tip percentage rather than hard coding the values
- [x] Split the bill option that has a quick view for upto 4 people
- [x] Split the bill effectively for n people
- [x] The values update automatically upon any change of any variable
- [x] Added constraints to be able to use on any apple device, not just an iPhone 5 as the video suggests
- [x] Deactivated sideway view
- [x] Screenshot button to screenshot receipt and easily send to friends
- [x] Share your experience on Facebook

## Notes

This was my first application in Swift. The complication I faced were with global variables. Many times, I would create functions that wouldn't really do anything
because the variables that these functions were composed of, had no values assigned to them yet. The layout was also an issue that I faced.
